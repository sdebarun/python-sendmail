# python sendmail using smtplib

A simple working script of sending email using smtplib library in python `
please replace the entities begin with YOUR_, e.g, YOUR_MAIL_SERVER wouldbe replaced by the smtp server domain name you are using.`
A log file will be generated in the directory the script will be running.
I have used yahoo but you can use any smtp server.

Gmail (will need App Password)	      -      smtp.gmail.com
Yahoo Mail (will need App Password)   -     smtp.mail.yahoo.com
Outlook.com/Hotmail.com	              -      smtp-mail.outlook.com
AT&T	                              -      smpt.mail.att.net (Use port 465)
Verizon	                              -      smtp.verizon.net (Use port 465)
Comcast	                              -      smtp.comcast.net
